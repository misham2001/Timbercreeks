                                Business insurance comes in many forms. What your commercial insurance policy covers
                                will depend on the type of business you own and the coverage you choose. Generally,
                                business insurance is designed
                                to cover bodily injury or medical expenses, libel, slander, defending lawsuits, and
                                settlements from court claims.

                                The cost of business insurance varies depending on several factors,
                                including the size and type of the business, its location, industry,
                                annual revenue, number of employees, coverage limits, and risk factors associated with
                                its operations.
                                Small businesses generally pay between hundreds and thousands of dollars annually for
                                coverage,
                                while large enterprises may face much higher premiums due to their increased exposure to
                                risks and greater
                                financial stakes. Businesses should obtain quotes from multiple
                                insurance providers to compare prices and ensure they're getting the coverage they need
                                at a competitive rate.
